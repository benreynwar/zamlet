Load/Store Reservation State
----------------------------
inputs
  i_valid
  i_mode
  i_address (8 bit address or 3 bit reg address + 2 bit w ident) (9 bit total)
  i_dst_addr (3 bit reg address + 2 bit w ident)
  i_value (32 bit value or 3 bit reg address + 2 bit w ident) (33 bit total)
    i_value and i_dst_addr is either or so we can manage with 33 bit for both

  write_valids[3:0]  (writes coming from the ALU or store or packets or loop)
  write_values[3:0][31:0] (write values)
  write_addresses[3:0][3+2-1:0]

outputs
  o_valid
  o_mode
  o_address
  o_value or o_dst_addr
