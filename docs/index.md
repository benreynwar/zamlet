A parameterizable open source VLIW SIMT processor designed for mesh accelerators.

![Bamlet Flow](diagrams/bamlet_flow.png)

## Overview

Zamlet is a research processor implementing a **VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word) SIMT (Single Instruction, Multiple Thread)** architecture designed for parallel computation across processing elements in a mesh topology. The project demonstrates advanced microarchitecture concepts including out-of-order execution, register renaming, and mesh networking.

### Key Features

- **VLIW Architecture**: 6 parallel instruction slots per bundle (Control, Predicate, Packet, ALU Lite, Load/Store, ALU)
- **SIMT Execution**: Single instruction stream across multiple processing elements with predication support
- **Out-of-Order Execution**: Reservation stations with operand capture and dependency resolution
- **Register Renaming**: Version-tagged registers for dynamic dependency tracking  
- **Mesh Network**: Lightweight inter-processor communication with X-Y routing
- **Configurable**: Parameterizable grid sizes, register file sizes, and execution unit configurations
