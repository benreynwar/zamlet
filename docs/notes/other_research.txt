KiloCore (UC Davis)

  Led by Professor Bevan Baas, this 1000-core processor (2016) features:
  - 992 cores in a 32Ã—31 grid plus 8 orchestrating cores
  - Each core has independent memory and program counter
  - 1.78 trillion instructions/second with only 0.7W power
  - Published in IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits

  Intel SCC (Single-chip Cloud Computer)

  48-core research processor (2009) with:
  - 24 tiles, each containing 2 P54C cores
  - On-chip network with message passing buffers
  - Distributed orchestration model mimicking cloud datacenters
  - Each core can run separate OS instances

  MIT/Tilera TILE64

  Originated from MIT research led by Anant Agarwal:
  - 64 cores in mesh topology
  - Homogeneous design with distributed control
  - VLIW processors with mesh interconnect
  - Commercialized as one of first successful manycore processors

  HERO Platform (ETH Zurich)

  Heterogeneous research platform combining:
  - RISC-V manycore accelerator clusters
  - ARM Cortex-A host processors for orchestration
  - FPGA-based implementation for flexibility

  Kalray MPPA-256

  Commercial manycore with hierarchical orchestration:
  - 256 user cores + 32 system cores
  - 16 compute clusters with dedicated management cores
  - Network-on-chip with distance-aware routing

  These examples demonstrate various approaches to combining simple processing arrays with more powerful orchestrating processors for different application domains.
