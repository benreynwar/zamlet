According to Claude...

Specification-Based Benchmarks:
  - Graph500 - Defines graph traversal problems (BFS, SSSP) with performance metrics, not implementation
  - HPCG - Specifies conjugate gradient algorithm requirements, allows custom optimizations
  - RandomAccess - Defines random memory access pattern, implementation flexibility
  - Sort - Sorting benchmark with specified input/output requirements

  Algorithm-Focused Suites:
  - PERFECT - Power Efficiency Revolution For Embedded Computing Technologies (algorithm specs)
  - DARPA HIVE - Graph analytics problems with performance targets, not code
  - MLPerf - Machine learning benchmark with model accuracy requirements

  Competition-Style Benchmarks:
  - STAC - Securities Technology Analysis Center (financial algorithms)
  - DEBS Grand Challenge - Stream processing problems with dataset specifications
  - LDBC - Linked Data Benchmark Council (graph database workloads)

  Research Benchmark Frameworks:
  - GAPBS - Graph Algorithm Platform Benchmark Suite (problem definitions)
  - TAU - Performance analysis framework allowing custom instrumentation

  These let you implement the algorithms in:
  - Custom assembly languages
  - Domain-specific architectures (FPGA, ASIC)
  - Novel programming models
  - Hardware accelerators

  You're measured on correctness and performance metrics rather than using specific source code, making them ideal for evaluating non-traditional architectures.
